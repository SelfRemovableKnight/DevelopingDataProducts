## TUPRA - The App for countless occasions

TUPRA is The Ultimate Plant Recognition App. It will make you - together with it - the absolute expert in plants ... which comes in handy under many more circumstances than you might think!

* At the florist's, make sure you get the exact right species your wife prefers, thus saving your marriage.
* On a walk with your ever-curious child through flowery fields, be ready for any question. Show them daddy knows everything. 
* When one of your biology students brings in another weird specimen, find out what it is in under a minute. Be "the" authority on campus.
* When captured by an undiscovered tribe in the Bornean jungle, where the chief's young son is suffering from an illness that can only be cured by one plant ... be able to get that one right plant in time. Next, become the tribe's new god!

## TUPRA - Profound science, easy as pie 

* Underlying TUPRA is state-of-the-art data science. The classification logic is based on data from the most carefully collected data sets, processed with the most advanced machine learning techniques.
* Nevertheless, through careful selection of variables, TUPRA only asks you for a few parameters, selected both for ease-of-measurement and relevance to the classification at hand. The app tells you right on the screen what to measure and where to put the results. Science was never this easy!

## TUPRA - cautious, open-minded, adaptable, extendable

* TUPRA will not blindly assign a label to any plant you present to it, but will express doubt when appropriate, e.g. when a specimen is really a borderline case between two species. TUPRA knows when it doesn't know, and handles this gracefully.
* TUPRA is able to deal with the discovery of previously unknown species. If your measurements do not match any existing species, TUPRA will not reject them, but let you know you might have made an important scientific discovery.
* TUPRA is extendable with new species that are discovered
* TUPRA has been kickstarted with the current Iris prototype, but will ultimately cover any plant type in the world ... or the multiverse. Note that early adopters of the Iris prototype will get free access to the full power of TUPRA.

## TUPRA prototype - Background & Credits

* The TUPRA prototype is based on an analysis of Edgar Anderson's Iris data set. The relation between the species and the chosen parameters for the TUPRA model is plotted below.
